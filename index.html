It diplays qualities necessary for a store of value such as scarcity (only 21 million coins to ever be mined) and a low (and decreasing) inflation rate. Bitcoin is currently the greatest form of money that has ever been created/discovered. Thankyou Satoshi Nakamoto! </div>

A smart contract is a self executing contract with the terms of the contract between parties written directly into the code. Ethereum is the first, and largest Smart Contract compatible blockchain.</div>

                <div class="text">Non-Fungible Tokens, better known as "NFTs" are cryptographic assets stored on a blockchain. They are considered "non-fungible" as each NFT is unique and as such cannot be traded as though one NFT is the same as another, no matter how similar they may appear. Currently NFTs are akin to "Blockchain Art" though future applications will (and already are) use the power of Bllockchain technology to tokenise real world assets such as houses, artwork, event ticket (or access to a club like Bored Ape Yacht Club), or other rare collectibles like wine or watches.</div>
